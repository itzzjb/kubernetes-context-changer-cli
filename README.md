## Quick Start

```sh
# Download and install (Linux/macOS)
wget https://github.com/itzzjb/kubernetes-context-changer-cli/releases/latest/download/ktx-<os>-<arch>
chmod +x ./ktx-<os>-<arch>
sudo mv ./ktx-<os>-<arch> /usr/local/bin/ktx
ktx
```

---

## Supported Platforms
- Linux (amd64, arm64)
- macOS (amd64, arm64)
- Windows (amd64)

---

## Installation

### Mac / Linux
1. Download the binary for your OS from the [Releases](https://github.com/itzzjb/kubernetes-context-changer-cli/releases) page.
2. Make it executable and move to your PATH:
   ```sh
   chmod +x ./ktx-<os>-<arch>
   mv ./ktx-<os>-<arch> ktx
   sudo mv ./ktx /usr/local/bin
   ```
3. Or build from source (requires Go 1.18+):
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/itzzjb/kubernetes-context-changer-cli.git
   cd kubernetes-context-changer-cli
   go build -o ktx
   sudo mv ./ktx /usr/local/bin
   ```
4. Run `ktx` to verify installation:
   ```sh
   ktx
   ```

### Windows
1. Download `ktx-windows-amd64.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/itzzjb/kubernetes-context-changer-cli/releases).
2. Rename to `ktx.exe`.
3. Add the folder containing `ktx.exe` to your system `PATH`.
4. Run from Command Prompt or PowerShell:
   ```sh
   ktx
   ```
> - You can also run the tool by double-clicking `ktx.exe`, but it is designed for interactive use in a terminal.
> - Make sure your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is set if your kubeconfig is not in the default location (`%USERPROFILE%\.kube\config`).

---

## Usage

Switch context interactively:
```sh
ktx
```

List all available contexts:
```sh
ktx list
```

Switch to a specific context:
```sh
ktx <context-name>
```

---

## Configuration

- By default, `ktx` uses the kubeconfig at `$KUBECONFIG` or `~/.kube/config`.
- To use a different kubeconfig:
  ```sh
  ktx --kubeconfig <path-to-kubeconfig>
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **macOS Security Warning:**
  When running `ktx` for the first time on macOS, you may see a security warning.
  > [!CAUTION]
  > **Apple cannot verify this app for malicious software**
  >
  > This is standard for open source CLI tools not distributed via the Mac App Store.
  >
  > **Solution:**
  > 1. Right-click the `ktx` binary and choose **Open**. Click **OK** in the dialog. You only need to do this once per version.
  > 2. Or, if you see a quarantine error, run:
  >    ```sh
  >    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./ktx
  >    ```

- **Command not found:**
  Ensure the binary is in your `PATH` and is executable.

- **Permission denied:**
  Use `chmod +x ./ktx` to make it executable.

## FAQ

**Q: Does `ktx` modify my kubeconfig?**
A: `ktx` only switches the current context; it does not modify or delete clusters, users, or contexts.

**Q: Can I use `ktx` with multiple kubeconfig files?**
A: Yes, set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable before running `ktx`.

**Q: Is telemetry or analytics collected?**
A: No, `ktx` does not collect or send any telemetry data.
